Method Document, Group 7
This is a draft that contains possible issues and questions that came up thinking about the experiment. issues are usually in footnotes.
In red and in footnotes are issues that came up with the experiment
We’re planning to run the experiment either with a custom-made program that we will write, or in a system that supports it (we don’t have one yet).
Forms would be filled on a free monday.com app that supports collection of forms into boards (and then can be easily downloaded to excel or analyzed in house).
Subject group:
40 Israeli Arabs (18-40) both Men and Women recruited on social platforms such as facebook, whatsapp, etc. would be randomly assigned into 2 groups (in-group, out-group) where each group would be split by information exposure period (Pre-set1, Per-set2 Set 1, Set 2). Information would be presented before the set name, so Set 1 group would see the information before Set 1, and Set 2 group would see the information before the second set.
Procedure:
The order of the experiment is as follows:

Instructions (See Appendix A1)
Attention Check (See Appendix A2)
[Prisoner’s Dilemma] Learning Phase [30 Rounds] | Measured set 1 [40 Rounds] (Explanation and screenshots on Appendix B)
Pause & Instructions 2 & Manipulations (See Appendix C)
Measured set 2 [40 Rounds] (same as measured Set 1)
Manipulation Check: Masked Trust Questionnaire 2 (Appendix D)
General Questions (Appendix E)

Appendix A1 - Instructions

The instructions would be as follow: (changes in red indicate difference between groups):
“ Welcome!
Set1, Ingroup [You will play with another participant form Tel Aviv University, A]
Set1, outgroup [You will play with another participant from Hebrew University, A]
Set2[]

Instructions to game…

Your goal is to make decisions about investing in a joint project to maximize your total earnings.
Each round, you both get tokens (e.g., 10 tokens).
Decide how many tokens to put in the project (0 to 10). Keep the rest.
After both contribute, tokens in the project are multiplied (e.g., by 1.5) and divided equally between both players.
The game has a set number of rounds. Each round, you get new tokens.
Your total score is the sum of earnings from all rounds. Aim to get the highest score. “
Input -
Your first letter in your name:
Your university: {

Appendix A2 - Instructions
Need to write

Appendix C - Prisoner’s Dilemma [Learning + Set A]

The subject would start playing a game with another player (unknowingly to the subject, a computer) that would play with the following algorithm: Tit For Tat +-20% from last contribution.
The learning stage would be the first 30 rounds; those would not be counted towards the game, and are being given just so that the subject would learn the other player’s algorithm. Players' contributions would be recorded as “Learning phase”.

A set (Set A) would then start with the computer playing the same algorithm, and Player’s contributions would be recorded as “Set A”.

This is the screen which would be shown to the subject with his total score incrementing with rounds.
Appendix C - Pause & Instructions 2 & Manipulations
In this stage, the subject will receive this message:
“Thank you for playing the 1st set with A[from Tel Aviv University, Hebrew University, “”]”, in the next part you will continue playing another set of rounds with A. The game would restart will resume in 20 seconds”

Appendix D - Masked Trust Questionnaire
The questionnaire we chose to use is an adaptation of the Dyadic Trust Scale that is originally meant for close relationships (romantic partner, friend, parent), and that we adapted to our needs. The questionnaire includes 8 items. Some items (1,3,5) are reverse coded (measure distrust).

My teammate is primarily interested in his/her own welfare. (reverse-coded)
My teammate is open and sincere with me.
My teammate is unpredictable. (reverse-coded)
I feel that I can trust my teammate completely.
My teammate treats our discussions like a game where the goal is to outwit me. (reverse-coded)
My teammate is truly concerned about my welfare.
I have confidence in my teammate's judgment.
My teammate is basically honest and reliable.

Appendix E - General Questions

This is the last part of free text, and it will come just in order to get some inputs from the subjects in order to have some insight on what happened. It’s not a variable that we plan working with systematically.
It shouldn’t affect the experiment since it is at the end of the experiment and therefore does not affect the subject's behavior.

Biases Check:
Item 1 sneakily that the person doesn’t think it’s a computer - Ideas?
Item 2 - What did you think the purpose of the experiment was?

AFTER:
We should ask the following questions:
Do you think your behavior / Average contribution changed before and after the 20 second break? (Yes / No)
If your behavior Changed, Why do you think it changed? (Free Text)

Ingroup / Outgroup manipulation:

Get from the person:
Age, City of birth

Manipulation:
You’re playing against A, Age 25, [From Herzelia] (Jews)
You’re playing against A, Age 25, [From Um El Fahem] (Arabs)
You’re playing against A, Age 25 [] (Ambiguous)
